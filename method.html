			<p99> To get the ball rolling, of this Dada poem assignment I chose “Polarize” song<br> in “blurry face” album of Twenty one pilots.<br><br>  I believed, one of the song’s messages is that acceptance of the truth <br>about one’s self will enable a person to know the truth <br>of what must be done outside the self in the rest of the world.<br> Personally, I feel a resemblance between this song and Dada movement that<br> they are both have a kind of rebelious, brave, artitstic, self-questioning,…feeling.<br> Therefore, my main idea was to visualized this song with dadaist poem technique<br> based on the lyrics and imagination. <br>For instance, the main focus of the layout is a big black doors with stairs based on the sentence:<br>“Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems” <br> as I imagined a view form the basement bottom up.<br> Those rotating red and blue patterns represented a hypotized feeling <br> like a vortex of thinking and finding the true self.<br> There are lots of hand images are poitning everywhere based on these sentences: <br>” Polarize is taking your disguises<br>
Separating em, splitting em up from wrong and right<br>
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight<br>
Deny, deny, denial” <br> There are also many letter “A” gave a sense of someone is screaming<br>  through the process of embracing his or her true self.<br>  As we know Polarization is a process that causes sunglasses to only accept lightwaves <br> that are coming straight towards the glasses, reducing glare from other reflective surfaces.<br> Polarized sunglasses helps the wearer  to see exactly what they are looking at<br>  more clearly than usual for that reason I created a glasses made by two letters “P”. <br>Finally, you can read the whole word Polarize and the word "find me" <br> as a hint for the link to the second page with a little bit of creativity and humor. <br>

<br> My goal is to create a as much Dada feeling as possible <br>  with a touch of bold elements as brushes, illustrations,… and experiement with typos<br>  since Dada, itself is regconizable by uncoventional typographic design,<br>  spontaneous mixing fonts not in any particular orders ,<br>  printing both horizontally and vetically on a single sheet,<br>  and sprinkling texts with randomly chosen symbols  such as a pointing hands, a scissors,… . </p99>
